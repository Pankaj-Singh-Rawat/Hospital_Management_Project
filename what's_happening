#Here, I will test different type of methods and techniques that I'll learn during the making of this feid project.

#METHOD: json!!!
import json 
#handles json data.
#this imports json(javascript object notation) which is a lightweight data interchange format
#also it is easy to use and interpret by the developer and computer.

#METHOD: testing Hash!!!
import hashlib
hash_object = hashlib.sha256()
# hash_object is hashed(orginal value is changed , mainly to encrypt a password-.) here already but to get it's value for us to see
# we can do this.
hash_value = hash_object.hexdigest()
print("has_value of SHA-256 is:" , hash_value)
# expected answer == e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
